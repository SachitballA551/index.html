Changu Narayan is a synonymous word with both the old Nepalese temple and the village that surrounds it. Located in the Bhaktapur district some 12 km east of Kathmandu, Changu Narayan is the oldest temple in Nepal and has an authentic Newari style architecture very true to its roots. With its two-storey brick-red edifice, the beautiful temple perches atop a hill which is also called Changu or sometimes Dolagiri.

The Changu Narayan temple is devoted to Lord Vishnu and houses several of his avatars and some other deities as well. And like every other Hindu temple in the subcontinent, this temple too has two separate faiths regarding its past â€“ one corresponds with the recorded history as we know it and another one is a legend as told by the local folklore. Surrounding Changu Narayan are dense woods of Champak tree, and this forest plays an important role in the legends associated with the temple.
