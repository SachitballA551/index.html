<p style="font-size:25px;font-family:Comic Sans MS;text-align:justify;">
The Bhaktapur Durbar Square is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was once home to the royal family of Bhaktapur. Locally known as Khwopa or the ancient Newa City, visitors can explore the entire complex that consists of four different squares â€“ Taumadhi Square, Durbar Square, Pottery Square and Dattatreya Square. Typical findings here are the Bhaktapur royal palaces along with several temples and other ancient structures dating back to the 17th and the 18th century.

    Bhaktapur Durbar Square is located about 13 kilometres to the east of the Kathmandu Valley. The entire square is a massive display of traditional Newari architecture. Every building is a work of art in itself and visitors are sure to enjoy exploring. The square was severely damaged in the 1934 and 2015 earthquakes that hit Nepal. Most of the ancient architecture suffered, and several buildings, statues and structures were destroyed. Other buildings underwent some restoration, but visitors can still see the signs of the damage.
